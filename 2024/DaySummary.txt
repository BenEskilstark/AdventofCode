Day 1:
    - comparing differences between sorted lists
    - comparing number of occurrences of values between lists
Day 2:
    - finding monotonic lists with less than certain distance between elements
    - finding those lists where removing one element also counts as passing
Day 3:
    - parsing a string for mul(3,2) commands
    - parsing that string but filtering by do() and don't()
Day 4:
    - Finding XMASes in a grid of chars
    - Finding MASes in an X shape in the grid of chars
Day 5:
    - Determining lists that are ordered based on pairwise ordering rules
    - Ordering the unordered lists based on those rules
Day 6:
    - positions of guard as she bounces around a grid
    - number of possible cycles created by guard by adding one obstacle at a time
Day 7:
    - Possible ways to add or multiply a list of numbers together
    - Add or multiply or string concat the list of numbers
Day 8:
    - Finding points (dist) away from each pair of points in a grid
    - Finding all points on a line between each pair of points in a grid
