Day 1:
    - comparing differences between sorted lists
    - comparing number of occurrences of values between lists
Day 2:
    - finding monotonic lists with less than certain distance between elements
    - finding those lists where removing one element also counts as passing
Day 3:
    - parsing a string for mul(3,2) commands
    - parsing that string but filtering by do() and don't()
